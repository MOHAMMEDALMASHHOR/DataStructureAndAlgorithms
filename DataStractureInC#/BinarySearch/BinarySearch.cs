//First of all we have to create the algorithm for the Binary search 
//Which is depending on sorting the elemants and then find the middle element and then compare the middle element with the target element
//If the target element is greater than the middle element then we have to search the right side of the middle element
//If the target element is less than the middle element then we have to search the left side of the middle element
//If the target element is equal to the middle element then we have to return the index of the middle element
//If the target element is not found then we have to return -1
//The time complexity of the Binary search is O(log n)
//The space complexity of the Binary search is O(1)
//The Binary search is the most efficient searching algorithm
//The Binary search is used to search the element in the sorted array
//The Binary search is used to search the element in the sorted list
//The Binary search is used to search the element in the sorted matrix
//The Binary search is used to search the element in the sorted string
//The Binary search is used to search the element in the sorted tree
